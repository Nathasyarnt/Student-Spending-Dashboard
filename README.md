## Final Conclusion
To reduce housing expenses, several solutions are proposed:
- Campus Dormitories: Universities can provide affordable on-campus housing or collaborate with housing providers to offer subsidized options for students.
- Housing Grants or Stipends: Financial aid or grants specifically for housing could be provided to students in need.
- Shared Accommodation: Encouraging shared apartments or dorms can help lower individual housing costs.
- Community Partnerships: Collaborations with local landlords for discounted rental rates or special student housing near campus.
  
These solutions could help reduce the overall spending burden on students.
